Giorgio studied Economics at Wilfrid Laurier University, but realized that his true passion lay in software development. He taught himself how to code while in school and eventually started a software company that would lead to him getting accepted into the [Next 36](https://www.nextcanada.com/next-36/) program in 2016. Although his company didn't succeed, he came out of the experience learning A LOT and knowing that software + startups are his passion.

p.s. we're hiring smart folks :)
