summary: Documenting 2021's highlights of Caribou's Engineering team
---

2021 proved to be a massive success for Caribou as a whole. We managed to:

- Form a fast-paced and experienced founding engineering team with an obsession over code quality + correctness, functional programming and moving hella fast âš¡
- Ship 3 separate web applications to end users, develop an email notifications system, a feature flagging system, a secure HIPAA-complient email alternative, and much more
- Close 7 Firms, each with somewhere between \$300 million to \$2.7B in Assets Under Management!!!
- Closed our seed round of $2.5M by some of the best angels in the startup scene (round led by the Altmans)

In this post we are going to cover some of our proudest technical moments.

## First order of business: Getting Our First App In Production

After quite a lot of back-and-forth, a search for a founding engineer had come to its conclusion in January, and [Giorgio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giorgiodelgado/) joined with a burning desire to execute on the company's vision of *creating a world where healthcare doesn't get in the way of living*, in addition to his own passion for creating high-performance & exceptional engineering teams.

At the time of joining, Caribou had a single web application that had been developed by a contractor.

This one application became known as "HA Dash", and was being developed at the time in a waterfall style. It was deemed to be not yet "fully complete", and as such, had not yet been put to use by our internal team.

Becoming more agile. Deleting code for things that weren't in use but getting in the way.

In January, Caribou's cofounders, [Christine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinesimone3/) and [Cory](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coryblumenfeld/) began reaching out to experienced eng folks in order to find an experienced engineer to help develop a solid engineering organization. At the time, the Caribou team was already working with various financial advisors in the US, but without any in-house software. Rather; the team was leveraging no-code tools, substantial Google Sheets and manual processes in order to deliver value to financial advisors and their clients.
